# Autodesk Post Processor - Syntec

[FANUC](https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmposts?p=fanuc) post processor modified for a Syntec milling machine.

This post has been modified to use the hard-coded machine configuration. To use the CAM machine configuration, set the `if (true)` inside `function defineMachine()` to `if (false)`.
